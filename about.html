			<blockquote><strong>Company Overview</strong><br></blockquote>
			<blockquote>
					The idea to develop Food Feedback came from Denise Duffy. Denise, like many people, was trying to lose weight. She tried dieting and was working hard at the gym, but she wasn’t losing weight. She asked a trainer if she could share photos of her food.<br><br>
					Once she started, she realized this process created a record, encouraged self-reflection and provided an opportunity for her trainer to actively help her with her diet. As a result of taking and sharing photos of her food choices, Denise lost over 25 pounds and deci ed she wanted to give all people access to a community to be able to do the same.<br><br>
					While the app was in development, Denise and co-founder Melissa Cameron enjoyed sharing their food experiences with family and friends. It offered them a daily connection with the people they care about, and the ability to “share a meal.”<br><br>
					With obesity and food-related health issues on the rise, and in the era of social media, apps, convenience and instant gratification, taking photos of what you eat is significantly more impactful and less time consuming than keeping a food log, and more compelling than calorie counting. By sharing images of your meals, and engaging with others about the food you’re consuming, you’ll have a new way to stay connected with family and friends, your personal trainer, or other food fans interested in creating beautiful, healthy meals and improving eating habits.
